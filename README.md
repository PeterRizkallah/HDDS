# Fun Facts
Hey there! I'm Peter Rizkallah and I plan on majoring in International Relations with a minor in either Computer Science or Economics (still deciding). I'm really interested in international development and intelligence work in the C.I.A., which is what prompted me to pursue a more technical route to international relations and hopefully enter the field of clandestine operations. I don't have much experience with coding but I enjoy making social media accounts for advocacy organizations such as the Environmental Council of Alexandria, which is where I've been able to collaborate with environmentalists. A hobby that I hold close to my heart is violin as it helps me stay focused and fuels my creativity in music.
