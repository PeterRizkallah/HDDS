A heated debate on data science is taking place as the field continues to expand and develop itself as a subfield of computer science. The question is whether data science can be useful in terms of being able to explain and provide insight, causality, and prediction through data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. As I progress in my studies of international relations and data science at William & Mary, I want to explore the many paths that can be traveled in my pursuit of education. I think data science can be incorporated into international relations by observing the various infrastructures that countries have that can help us improve national security in the states. In retrospect, the United States has not been able to detect the possibility of breaches into intellectual property, which the nation saw with the Solarwinds incident in which Russian hackers installed a malicious code was put into the system, causing many businesses to worry about their networks and information technology management. However, these incidents have proven that the United States can learn from international threats and hold these entities accountable by studying their behaviors in a global context. The study of data science can enhance our methods of predicting state behavior through GIS systems that could potentially be used to locate facilities in the world that could pose a threat to the United States, both militarily and digitally.
