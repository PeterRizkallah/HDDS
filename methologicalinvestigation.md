# Recovering From Unexpected Bombings in Lebanon

The ammonium nitrate explosion on the port of Beirut on August 4, 2020, led to a total of 218 deaths and 7,000 injuries, accompanied by the destruction of vital health infrastructure that caused many to bleed out or treat themselves at home. According to Beirut Ammonium Nitrate Explosion: A Man-Made Disaster in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic, “This event immediately overwhelmed the ability of Beirut hospitals, emergency medical services (EMS) agencies, first responder agencies, and other responding agencies to mount an effective response. Casualties flooded local hospitals with the less injured arriving first by private transportation or by walking to nearby hospitals and the more injured arriving later by EMS vehicles” (El Sayed, 2020). This meant that health officials in the area had no concrete plan of foreseeing this deadly event in which the current system of infrastructure was unable to support. Furthermore, many rescue teams were unable to work effectively since many of them were from outside of the country, which meant that a bulk of the recovery process was spent on informing foreign aid networks of the incident rather than having a solid and strategic plan to help people within the blast’s radius. However, Lebanese data analysts have recently implemented the use of GIS systems that account for areas in which civilians do not inhabit, such as the warehouse that stored the explosive chemicals at the port. According to Statistics Lebanon Polling and Research, “We now have listings of all dwellings, buildings, apartments, and other nonresidential uses indicated on the cluster map.” Although the use of data clusters was already part of the country’s geospatial capabilities, why were these recovery efforts not implemented, even with the use of cellular data to track affected individuals? This question could be answered with an in-depth analysis of countries that have also experienced a disaster that spread throughout their respective regions and how they were able to customize data science methods to fit their own geospatial obstacles.

# Optimizing Aid by Tracking Migration with Cell Cluster Data 

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is surrounded by many ancient volcanoes that erupt in an unpredictable time frame. Mount Nyiragongo is composed of volcanoes that surround the region in which people live, which could be observed to critique the current methods being used in Lebanon. Since these ancient volcanoes could not be predicted in terms of when they would erupt, scholars decided to investigate migratory patterns in an effort to effectively assign aid to the most vulnerable places, such as Goma, Bukavu, Sake, and Rutshura. Essentially, the focus of this research was aimed at discovering how to spend less time identifying which regions were impacted and more time on developing emergency responses that could be used in a sustainable way. This subscriber data was collected by Vodacom RDC and observed in their method of cluster data, taking a baseline measurement of a dataset as a percentage of subscriber mobility and comparing it to where inhabitants have relocated through a series of shaded dots on a map.
