# Remotely Measuring Populations during a Crisis by Overlaying Two Data Sources

Bharti, Nita, et al. "Remotely Measuring Populations during a Crisis by Overlaying Two Data Sources ." Oxford Academic Journals, 26 Feb. 2015, https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/7/2/90/662727?sid=92f0cba8-fd00-4b3d-b6fc-bbaf6406cfbc. Accessed 2 Oct. 2021.

Cote d'Ivoire presents a very politically unstable environment during the elections between the incumbent, Gbagbo, and the candidate that was running against him, Outtara. After Gbagbo lost his incumbency to Outtara, the population broke off into separate regions that clashed with each other through armed force. The outcome of this violence was the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Ivorians that sought refuge in neighboring countries, which was problematic for disaster organizations that sought to provide relief to communities that were under siege. Once the UN stepped in as an attempt to resolve tensions in the region, they found that reports on movements became very difficult as some Ivorians escaped without UN assistance.
To find a potential solution to this, the researchers in this study wanted to analyze the effects of political turmoil on migration patterns in Cote d'Ivoire. These regional issues can be cited by Amartya Sen's definition of freedom by relating political violence to the lack of constitutive parts of development, which is the innate freedom of being able to have political dissent in a government that is not fulfilling its role to its people. These freedoms provide the blueprint for development in this region by protecting people who have been hurt by a governing body either directly or indirectly. To combat this, data scientists are adopting new methods that account for other factors that make analyzing displacement a tough task. These obstacles consist of light pollution and cloudy nights, which can make satellite images unclear to researchers.
To make these methods more effective, cellular data was used in tandem with this nighttime satellite method, calling for the dual implementation of CDR (call detail records) and nighttime satellite monitoring. With technology on the horizon of measuring migratory rates, these methods can be used to illuminate the way for disaster relief organizations to accommodate their populations better.
Datasets to quantify this were gathered from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program for nighttime satellite imagery and Orange mobile for cellphone subscribers. In terms of the methods used, nighttime satellite imagery was measured in brightness values to detect light that is generated from human activity, which was said to correlate to the size of the population. Furthermore, the second method required the collection of data from mobile users by quantifying signals from cell towers. However, the researchers prefaced earlier in the study that these methods may be unintentionally biased due to the wealth that is associated with generating electricity and making phone calls, which is why the diversification of data science is important to gain an accurate insight into a particular region's crises.
